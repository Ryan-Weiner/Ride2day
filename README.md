# Ride2day
Is the weather suitable to go for a ride on your motorcycle? Skip the weather app, find out here

## But, why?
Well, why not?

## Really though, why?
As a motorcycle enthusiast and overall gear-head, the weather is important to make decisions such as which bike or car to take, along with what clothes I wear to ensure that I am dressed appropriately for the weather.  It could be warm enough to take the bike out for a ride, but maybe I might want to wear the full suit with a thermal lining instead of just the jacket and armored jeans.  Or maybe today is the day to take the car out. But should I take the AWD car or the RWD car? Or maybe I should just stay inside to watch tv and drink something hot.

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to create an app that displays the following data:
1. Temperature
2. Percipitation type
3. Percipitation time
4. Wind speed

A suggestion as to which vehicle to take and how to dress may be a future feature to add based on the data collected and displayed above.
